# Popsa.com - Arthur Fincham React Frontend test skeleton

## Notes

I decided to use Typescript to improve the dev experience, especially with changing the state of the items as it seemed quite complicated.

Chrome's mobile emulator seemed strange with touch event on images...

The animation is not perfectly aligned with the spec sadly; it's my best attempt!

## Getting Started

Use Node `v20.10.0`

```bash
nvm use 20.10.0
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
